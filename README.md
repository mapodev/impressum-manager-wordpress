# [Impressum Manager](http://www.impressum-manager.com)

Impressum Manager ([www.impressum-manager.com](http://www.impressum-manager.com)) is a Freemium Wordpress Plugin which manages all kind of aspects for posting an Imprint and Disclaimer.

The latest [stable release](https://wordpress.org/plugins/impressum-manager/) is 1.1.3

## Shortcode

We are introducing a shortcode system, which you can see the preview of that shortcode in the preview area of the plugins admin area. So you can decide which special part of the Impressum should be displayed in your Website.

### Shortcode Usage

To see the Impressum inside your website you can use the general shortcode `[impressum_manager]`, which will return the whole Impressum including the Disclaimer. To choose a specific part of the Impressum, use the preview system.

## Features

- **Impressum Generator**, generate a german Impressum with all your contact data. Disclaimers and Policies sources are used from eRecht24.
- **No Index**, allows you to tell the Search Engine not indexing the Impressum page. Checking also for colliding with other Wordpress Plugins.
- **E-Mail Image Converter**, switches the given E-Mail to a image, so spam bot parser are not able to read the E-Mail.
- **Importing Impressum**, makes it possible to import Impressum from an external link. So instead of the generated Impressum you can use this.
- **Image Credential Sum up System**, is a system which collects every credential given in an image and sums them in the Impressum. In detail, in the image source part.
- **Tutorial step system**, is a tutorial which leads you through the set up of the Impressum, the first time you visit the Plugin admin area.
