Impressum Generator

== Description ==

The Impressum Manager allows the user to generate the Impressum ( Legal Imprint )
automatically and manage it later on with only some few clicks.
The only imprint currently is in german. Others can follow.

The Impressum contains a privacy policy, disclaimer, contact fields and some more stuff.
Impressum Manager collects every name of the creator of an image by setting the name
in the name credit field in the image interface. Then the Manager sums the names in the
image sources so you don't have to write down every name of each image. This will do the
manager automatically.

Another option is to have the email represented by an image. This will reduce the
spam mails by parsing the website by a bot.
